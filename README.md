# Gene-Content-Heritabilty
Detecting low-quality SNPs, by estimating the proportion of variation of each SNP is explained by pedigree information.  It is expected this estimate to be 1. but in case of genotyping errors or genotypes are wrongly assigned to a large proportion of individuals, this value will be lower than one and it can denote the low-quality of SNP.
